    "1. I didn’t really enjoy performing this activity, probably because I don’t like grammar. However, I learned a lot about the components of sentences, which I did enjoy. The first two activities mentioned above, regarding Part-of-Speech tagging and chunking all noun phrases, went smoothly. However, the third activity, Named Entity Recognition, had some issues. It took hours and hours to execute the code. I even looked for optimization steps and tried batch processing and multiprocessing, but there wasn’t much difference. As a result, I stuck with batch processing and left the code running overnight.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Natural/Human language is very confusing. The same word has different meanings based on the context of the sentence. Thus, Part-of-Speech tagging, chunking, and Named Entity Recognition are vital processes for any NLP and text analysis projects. These activities are fundamental in many NLP applications, like search engines, information extraction, and document classification. Identifying and classifying named entities helps organize large sets of data into meaningful categories, making it easier to derive insights or automate decision-making processes."
