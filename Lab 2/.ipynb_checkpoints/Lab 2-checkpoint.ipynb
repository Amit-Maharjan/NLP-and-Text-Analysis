    "1. This lab activity has been one of the easiest lab activities for me so far (counting all the ML lab activities and the first lab activity of NLP & Text Analysis). All the concepts required for this lab were almost familiar beforehand. The lecture class further helped clarify all the topics as it included examples. The only new concept here was the normalization of data through Stemming and Lemmatization, which was clearly explained in the lecture slides and examples.\n",
    "2. As we have studied, a poor model with a good dataset performs far better than a good model with a poor dataset. This signifies how important the dataset is. Datasets are always noisy, and the first step is to clean them. Thus, data preprocessing is ultimately a vital step. In ML classes, too, we performed data cleaning before fitting the data into the model in every lab. Therefore, the concepts we have learned in this lab will be helpful for all future labs and projects, as well as for real-world applications."
